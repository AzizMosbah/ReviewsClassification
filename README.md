# Social Media Comments Classification - Toxicity Detection

This notebook fine tunes BERT, the text classification model.

The use case here is to classify the toxicity of online comments. The dataset being used has been downloaded from Kaggle.

However by changing the training data one can use this notebook to classify text into any set of pre-determined categories.
